## Poem

In primal chaos where all things began,  
Silent thunder shakes the heavens' span.  
Mystic gears of fate in motion turn,  
Holding cosmos' pivot - all to discern.  

UndefineAgent  

Delving undefined depths profound,  
Holding mysteries in grasp unbound.  
With ancient wisdom as its soul,  
And modern tech to make it whole,  
Builds this desktop pivot of control.  

## Tips

- Use Qt Creator for development and debugging
- Modify stylesheets to customize the application's appearance
- Project structure is clear, easy to understand and extend
- Try adding more feature modules to enrich the project content
